/*
 * Adapted from Exercise 8.5,
 * Introduction to Java Programming (Comprehensive)
 * by Y. Daniel Liang, 10th ed.
 *
 * Create a program called AddMatrices which
 * adds two 3x3 matrices and prints the result.
 * The program should prompt the user to enter
 * data for 2 matrices and then displays those
 * 2 matrices and the sum matrix.
 *
 * Example output:
 *
 * Enter matrix1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 * Enter matrix2: 0 2 4 1 4.5 2.2 1.1 4.3 5.2
 * The matrices are added as follows
 * 1.0 2.0 3.0     0.0 2.0 4.0     1.0 4.0 7.0
 * 4.0 5.0 6.0  +  1.0 4.5 2.2  =  5.0 9.5 8.2
 * 7.0 8.0 9.0     1.1 4.3 5.2     8.1 12.3 14.2
 *
 * Hint: You may need to use the Double.parseDouble("a string")
 * to convert the user input to doubles.
